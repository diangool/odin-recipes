    <h2>How to Make Lasagna</h2>

    <p>
      For this recipe, we are essentially making a thick, meaty tomato sauce and
      layering that with noodles and cheese into a casserole. Here's the
      run-down:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Start by making the sauce</strong> with ground beef, bell
        peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed
        tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of
        flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong
          >Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses
          ready.</strong
        >
        We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix
        of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>From there, it's just an assembly job.</strong> A cup of meat
        sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese.
        Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</strong></li>
    </ol>
